This is a quality-of-life Improvement for the original game.

# Planned additions include:  
Mouse Support (Dependent on Chilly finishing the code), Rotary Controller support (for fun), different HUD options, Music selection and or changer, multiple controller options, spectre options for different spectre mobs, and maybe more.

Many hours of hard work and effort have gone into providing this to the community.  We hope this inspires others to develop for the Atari Jaguar, and I would love some help on this project if anyone is interested.
